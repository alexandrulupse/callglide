This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## Gettings started

Use this project as a starting point for your next React project at Rubicon.
The project structure should scale well for any application, however feel free to change it's structure for your
own use case.

To get started take a closer look into _package.json_ for available commands.
The whole codebase is pretty small. Going through it file by file will give you a good picture about how it works.
